For part two of the project, I followed the directions and sepperated out into the various required files. I was under the impression that we would be using CMake for all 3 parts of the project, and was doing so by default as I am already rather familiar with CMake. However to fulfill the requirements I also added an option to compile using the provided Makefile. The cmake method should also function correctly.

This part ended up taking longer than I had anticipated because I initially began the project implementing everything with my own creative liberties, but once I found out in class that we should be following the instructions as if they were spec requirements I removed all of my extraneous fluff.

Besides some minor Makefile troubleshooting and git branch management pains the process was not too bad.
